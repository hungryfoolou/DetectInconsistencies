The Final Aim is to Detect the Inconsistencies in Public Security Vulnerability Reports.
So far,the program can craw some public security vulnerablility information. 

# Dependence

# User Guide
If you're in China,you need cross the Great Wall in order to make the program(craw_report.py) craw some websites(e.g. arch/info website).I use shadowsocks to run the program.Use `proxychains` to force the program run with the proxy.

If you need to cross the wall,run the program like this:

    proxychains python entry.py

If you don't need to cross the wall,you can run the program like this:  
    
    python entry.py
